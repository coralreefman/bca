    "## The Black Box & The Problem of Digitalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In the analog realm, cause and effect are a continuum; when a string is plucked on an acoustic musicial instrument like a guitar for example it sets air in vibration. We perceive this as sound; an everyday physical phenomenon. \n",
    "However, in the digital realm, an physical event is broken down into a stream of numbers, becoming discrete instead of continuous. This allows for the initial input to be mapped onto any possible output. The clear causal relationship between input and output has been lost. This requires utmost responsibility of the artist to define meaningful relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following texts expand on these notions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jean-François Lyotard in Les Immatériaux:\n",
    "**Digital versus Sublime**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many new technological inventions and artificial materials have changed this relationship of man to material reality, but for Lyotard the most fundamental and dramatic change has been introduced by the digital technologies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two things are important here: Lyotard maintains that we first of all relate to reality through the messages we receive from the outside environment. In the post-industrial societies these \n",
    "messages have become increasingly mediated. It is, however, a characteristic of mediation that the messages communicated through that medium have to be translated into the code of that particular medium. The digital technologies signify a fundamental break. All \n",
    "messages, regardless of their origin or constitution (image, sound, text, data, etc..) have to be translated into one universal code of digital information; the process of digitalisation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to process the information with a digital system the information has to be atomised, broken up into fundamental smallest units out of which every message is composed. Atomisation of information involves the need for a complete description of the phenomenon in terms of these smallest units. What falls outside of this description, because for example it is to small to be measured, is disregarded. Something of the original source-information is always lost in this process of atomisation and digitalisation of information. \"It is as if a filter has been placed between us and the things, a screen of numbers\", Lyotard \n",
    "writes in the press-release to Les Immatériaux. 2  \n",
    "\n",
    "These are exactly the two consequences Lyotard takes to be crucial to the problems that are posed by the 'Immaterials'. In an interview taken in May 1988 he re-stated the problem:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"The media are intended to close the system within itself, by incorporating the exteriorities in the system. As in 'Mother', 'mat' (from: 'maternité'= motherhood in French) signifies something which has given birth, so something which constitutes the secret of existence, and seems to be similar to the media in that sense. But the exteriority is preserved. This exteriority is found at the origin and is lost, it is however lost as an origin. The immaterials signify the loss of this lost thing. It is as if there is no origin at all. The important point is the incorporation of the exteriorities in the system, not just in the system of the media, but also of the techno-sciences in general. The consequence is that everything becomes a message, even the silence that strictly speaking does not tell anything, does not exist. \"Mother\" entails basically the concept that something has been lost (the origin), that its disappearance does not tell anything, but generates meaning.\" 3  \n",
    "\n",
    "(And in this sense the new technologies are not sublime)  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can now return to the main question of the manifestation: \"Do the 'Immaterials' change the relation of man to the material as it has been formulated in the modern tradition, for example by the Cartesian program: 'to become master and proprietor of nature ?\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the material is not just that on which human activity is acted out, it also entails a net of associations and polarities that determine how we relate to the world. Primary associations are; material versus spiritual, matter versus mind, matter versus energy, matter versus form, matter versus product. New materials change not only the conception of the materials as such but also this net of associations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To intensify the main-question, the manifestation chose to undermine \"..the indolent modern prejudice that the new materials maximise the control of man over nature\", by presenting disturbing views. (...) What is disturbing for man is that his (purported) identity as a human being is slipping from him. The substantive adjective \"Human\" signifies an old domain of knowledge and skills, which is now shared by the techno-sciences, that are breaking open this terrain. They are discovering and expanding analog (but generally more complex) immaterials to those (purported) human skills.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "The formerly mute materials are now performing human tasks, and often are even better at it (calculations, robotic assemblage etc..). For Lyotard the consequence of this development is that man has to face his place in the universe as being part of this material world. Man's privileged position as the sole cognoscente being is lost, while she/he is confronted with a reality that is to complex to comprehend and control. \"Consequently, the views associated with the concept of the \"Material\", that feed the immediate awareness of an identity as human, have become weaker. Notably: Experience, memory, work, autonomy (or freedom), even 'creation' and in general the difference with that which is not human. The feeling of a general interaction, however is intensified.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "This anxiety causes the desire for a new and stable identity, which according to Lyotard can take on thousand forms and sometimes even the form \"post-modern\".  \n",

    "### Lev Manovich on Digitalization\n",
    "\n",
    "\"These works also direct us to the map – the abstract space of possible transformations between signals. That domain of transformation is also inframedial, a key structure in digital media forms and cultures. Lev Manovich (2002) has described this question as the “built-in existential angst” of digital media: “By allowing us to map anything into anything else ... computer media simultaneously makes all these choices appear arbitrary….” In almost all digital media, the map – the pattern of relations between input and output – is imperceptible, obscured or encoded. This is clearest in the work of artists working explicitly with data inputs. In the work of Alex Drauglescu for example, spam email is used as the input to an algorithm that creates complex three dimensional forms. The mapping – the process that transforms spam into form – is never revealed, and so a concrete, specific process becomes a blank spot filled in with an impression of magical transubstantiation. In some computational work the artist provides source code, an explicit specification of the map but one that is highly encoded and unavailable, in itself, to perception. In most digital media objects, the map is inextricable from the residue or artefact it shapes. We perceive only the output, the image, sound or form, in which the input and its transformations are collapsed.\"\n",

    "\"When investigating theories at the tiniest conceivable scales in nature, almost all researchers today revert to the quantum language, accepting the verdict from the Copenhagen doctrine that the only way to describe what is going on will always involve states in Hilbert space, controlled by operator equations. Returning to classical, that is, non quantum mechanical, descriptions will be forever impossible, unless one accepts some extremely contrived theoretical constructions that may or may not reproduce the quantum mechanical phenomena observed in experiments.\n",
    "Dissatisfied, this author investigated how one can look at things differently. This book is an overview of older material, but also contains many new observations and calculations. Quantum mechanics is looked upon as a tool, not as a theory. Examples are displayed of models that are classical in essence, but can be analysed by the use of quantum techniques, and we argue that even the Standard Model, together with gravitational interactions, might be viewed as a quantum mechanical approach to analyse a system that could be classical at its core. We explain how such thoughts can conceivably be reconciled with Bell's theorem, and how the usual objections voiced against the notion of `superdeterminism' can be overcome, at least in principle. Our proposal would eradicate the collapse problem and the measurement problem. Even the existence of an \"arrow of time\" can perhaps be explained in a more elegant way than usual.\n",
