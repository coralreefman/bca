    "You always work in a directory in the file/directory structure on your drive. Which so called *working directory* you are currently working in, can be found out with `pwd`:  \n",

    "You can change the working directory with change directory or:  \n",

    "`cd ..`   \n",

    "You can also explicitly go to any directory on the drive by using path notation. The root or beginning of the hierarchy starts with a forward slash `/`, followed by a directory name or names separated by `/`s like so:  \n",
